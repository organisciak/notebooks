# notebooks

Various Jupyter/Colab notebooks.

https://colab.research.google.com is a great hosted notebook solution for small little projects, curiosities, etc. Yet, I find it leads me to sharing code less often. As somebody who learns so much from code searches on Github, that's a pity.

There isn't an organizing principle for this repo, other than this: sharing code for little projects, in case it's useful to some future internet wanderer trying to do something similar.
